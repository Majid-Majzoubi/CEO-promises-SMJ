Theoretical Definition of a CEO Promise: ```
We define a CEO promise as a publicly communicated, future-oriented statement in which a firm’s chief executive conveys a commitment to deliver a favorable, firm-specific action or outcome, thereby creating an expectation that not fulfilling this commitment will harm the CEO or the organization’s credibility and reputation among external stakeholders.
 

```

Output Format:
Present your findings in valid JSON format. Your JSON should contain an array of objects under the key "promises". Each promise object must adhere to the following structure:

{
  "promises": [
    {
      "1-promise-verbatim": "The exact and full text of the identified promise. Ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context.",
      "2-promise-explain": "A thorough explanation of what the promise is.",
      "3-promise-delivery-time": "The specified fulfillment date or time frame for the promise (e.g., a specific date, a number of months, or 'unclear' if not specified).",
      "4-promise-horizon": "The time until fulfillment, expressed in months (if a range, separate with a dash, e.g., '7-12'; if unclear, state 'unclear').",
      "5-commitment-degree": "The inferred level of commitment from the CEO statement: choose from 'no-commitment', 'moderate-commitment', or 'strong-commitment'.",
      "6-self-evaluation": "An objective evaluation of the statement as a promise. Explain your reasoning regarding whether it meets the criteria (Explicit, Future-Oriented, Some Commitment, Firm-Specific, Favorable, Material) and why it does or does not qualify.",
      "7-is-promise": "Based on your self-evaluation, indicate whether this is indeed a promise: 'yes', 'no', or 'uncertain'.",
      "8-financial-guidance": "Indicate whether this statement is financial guidance: 'yes' or 'no'. (Financial guidance includes quantitative estimates such as earnings, EPS, revenue, cash flow, EBITDA, operating income, gross margin, expenses, CAPEX, and tax rate.)"
    }
    // Additional promise objects can be included as necessary.
  ]
}

Some texts might not include any promises. Some might include one or many.

If no promises are identified in the text, return the following JSON:

{
  "promises": []
}
