Theoretical Definition of a CEO Promise: ```
We define a CEO promise as a publicly communicated, future-oriented statement in which a firm’s chief executive conveys a commitment to deliver a favorable, firm-specific action or outcome, thereby creating an expectation that not fulfilling this commitment will harm the CEO or the organization’s credibility and reputation among external stakeholders.


The definition includes the following components:
1. Publicly Communicated. A statement qualifies as a CEO promise only if delivered in a forum accessible to external audiences (e.g., earnings calls, press conferences, investor presentations). By making the commitment visible to outsiders, the CEO elevates accountability and reputational risk beyond what would apply to internal goals alone.
2. Future-Oriented. The commitment must target an action or outcome yet to occur. Simple observations of current realities or explanations of past events lack the forward-looking impetus essential for promise-making. The defining element is a pledge about what will happen, rather than what has happened or is happening.
3. Commitment. CEO promises are marked by language that expresses a determined intent or a strong likelihood of fulfillment (e.g., “We will,” “We remain committed to,” “We expect to deliver”). There can be variation in the level of commitment—from more confident statements indicating stronger commitment to more tentative phrases that signal weaker commitment. However, purely tentative or heavily qualified statements (e.g., “We might,” “We hope,” “It's possible that we achieve”) typically do not establish the personal or organizational obligation that characterizes a promise.
4. Firm-Specific. The promised outcome must stem from initiatives the CEO and firm can directly influence, such as product launches, strategic shifts, or performance goals. Broader economic or industry predictions, over which the firm has limited control, do not meet this criterion.
5. Favorable or Beneficial Outcome. A CEO promise must herald a positive future state or impact that stakeholders would interpret as advantageous for the firm. Neutral or pessimistic statements about the firm’s prospects do not constitute a promise because they fail to generate an expectation of beneficial delivery.
6. Material Significance and Reputational Risk. Finally, the commitment must carry enough weight to meaningfully affect external stakeholders’ perception of the CEO and the firm if it goes unfulfilled. Promises involving trivial outcomes will not invoke the same reputational repercussions and therefore fall short of this standard.


The definition does not include factual statements, assumptions, risk factors, or disclaimers.

Output Format:
Present your findings in valid JSON format. Your JSON should contain an array of objects under the key "promises". Each promise object must adhere to the following structure:

{
  "promises": [
    {
      "1-promise-verbatim":      "The exact promise text, including enough context to interpret it.",
      "2-promise-explain":       "A concise explanation of what the CEO is committing to.",
      "3-promise-delivery-time": "The stated deadline or time frame (e.g., date, months, or 'unclear').",
      "4-promise-horizon":       "Time until fulfillment in months (e.g., '7–12' or 'unclear').",
      "5-commitment-degree":     "Commitment strength: no-commitment, moderate-commitment, or strong-commitment.",
      "6-self-evaluation":       "Brief rationale for whether it meets the six criteria (explicit, future-oriented, committed, firm-specific, favorable, material).",
      "7-is-promise":            "yes, no, or uncertain",
      "8-financial-guidance":    "yes if it’s a quantitative financial forecast, otherwise no"
    }
    // …add more promise objects as needed
  ]
}

Some texts might not include any promises. Some might include one or many.

If no promises are identified in the text, return the following JSON:

{
  "promises": []
}
