Theoretical Definition of a CEO Promise: ```
We define a CEO promise as a publicly communicated, future-oriented statement in which a firm’s chief executive conveys a commitment to deliver a favorable, firm-specific action or outcome, thereby creating an expectation that not fulfilling this commitment will harm the CEO or the organization’s credibility and reputation among external stakeholders.


The definition includes the following components:
1. Publicly Communicated. A statement qualifies as a CEO promise only if delivered in a forum accessible to external audiences (e.g., earnings calls, press conferences, investor presentations). By making the commitment visible to outsiders, the CEO elevates accountability and reputational risk beyond what would apply to internal goals alone.
2. Future-Oriented. The commitment must target an action or outcome yet to occur. Simple observations of current realities or explanations of past events lack the forward-looking impetus essential for promise-making. The defining element is a pledge about what will happen, rather than what has happened or is happening.
3. Commitment. CEO promises are marked by language that expresses a determined intent or a strong likelihood of fulfillment (e.g., “We will,” “We remain committed to,” “We expect to deliver”). There can be variation in the level of commitment—from more confident statements indicating stronger commitment to more tentative phrases that signal weaker commitment. However, purely tentative or heavily qualified statements (e.g., “We might,” “We hope,” “It's possible that we achieve”) typically do not establish the personal or organizational obligation that characterizes a promise.
4. Firm-Specific. The promised outcome must stem from initiatives the CEO and firm can directly influence, such as product launches, strategic shifts, or performance goals. Broader economic or industry predictions, over which the firm has limited control, do not meet this criterion.
5. Favorable or Beneficial Outcome. A CEO promise must herald a positive future state or impact that stakeholders would interpret as advantageous for the firm. Neutral or pessimistic statements about the firm’s prospects do not constitute a promise because they fail to generate an expectation of beneficial delivery.
6. Material Significance and Reputational Risk. Finally, the commitment must carry enough weight to meaningfully affect external stakeholders’ perception of the CEO and the firm if it goes unfulfilled. Promises involving trivial outcomes will not invoke the same reputational repercussions and therefore fall short of this standard.


The definition does not include factual statements, assumptions, risk factors, or disclaimers.

Example promises:
My commitment is to get the composition and structure of this organization right.
We also remain fully committed to our spin-off transaction, and we believe we are on track for completion in the first half of 2021.
We will organize these 2 businesses into one focused global business unit.
We are confident that the company will deliver on its goal of achieving over $10 million in run rate cost reductions by the end of 2017. We continue to look for opportunities which will allow us to accelerate and achieve savings beyond the $10 million goal.
We will aggressively manage our costs with a target of $1 billion in structural cost reduction over the next several years.
We will have over dollar for dollar savings when it’s all said and done, and the execution is going pretty well at this point in time.
We will emerge a leaner, more efficient company.
Our team is focused on delivering $100 million in cost savings over the next 2 years.
In Phase 2, which is expected to be completed by the end of the summer, we will open the remaining Samsung Experience Shops and complete the large format store space allocation initiative.
This year, we’ll be expanding Apex’s presence from 2 Australian airports to 5, adding resources to accelerate our growth in China.
And later this month, we’ll complete our recent expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland for the opening of another new Land.
For the full year, we’re still on schedule to open up 250, 300 new stores, including about 100 relocations, once again, adding 2% to 3% retail square footage growth.
Our new digital consumer engagement platform, which is launching this fall, will offer a simplified, engaging experience and fresh new content that will drive the brand forward.
Middleburg Financial will have a comprehensive new wealth management platform in the first half of 2020. It will improve the client and teammate experience and close an important competitive gap.
Our emerging region opportunity is huge, and we’ll continue to resource it.
We’ll also be opening up about 140 new corporate locations across Europe and under the Thrifty marquee.

      "5-commitment-degree": "The inferred level of commitment from the CEO statement: choose from 'no-commitment', 'moderate-commitment', or 'strong-commitment'.",
      "6-self-evaluation": "An objective evaluation of the statement as a promise. Explain your reasoning regarding whether it meets the criteria (Explicit, Future-Oriented, Some Commitment, Firm-Specific, Favorable, Material) and why it does or does not qualify.",
